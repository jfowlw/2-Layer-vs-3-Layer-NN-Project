# 2-Layer-vs-3-Layer-NN-Project

### Problem Definition
The goal is the train a neural network to classify a set of data points into two categories. Along the way,
different learning rates, number of layers, and number of hidden nodes will be tested to find optimal numbers. Additionally,
overfitting models will be addressed with L2 regularization. In the end, this will allow the neural network to make 
predictions on data points with an unknown classification.The data is assumed to be related with a possible 
known, correct classification out there.
